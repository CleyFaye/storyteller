- Customizable font (font face, font type, font size)
- Justify text
- Check how paragraphs are split, maybe I broke something
- Always regenerate test page (in accordance to font settings while we're at it)
- Customizable player: scaling, element "theme"
- Real randomization: have different amount of dials in the player, use a predictive prng to get effective paragraph variants
